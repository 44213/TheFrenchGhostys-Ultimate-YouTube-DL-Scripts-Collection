## Archivist Scripts? Audio-Only Scripts? Watch Scripts?

Archivists Scripts: Scripts made for data archivists/data hoarder: The scripts to use if you want to save some specific content in the best possible quality along with every possible metadata.

Audio-Only Script: Script made to download audio-only content (or that will extract the audio from videos that contain it) in the best possible quality.

Watch Scripts: Scripts made to download content that is made to be watched and deleted, only download the videos, without metadata.

### Archivist Scripts:

Downloading and archiving "live" content is complicated, especially because gigabytes of it will be created each day.

Considering that I chose to separate the content:

Archive Scripts: Scripts that will download everything that was created before December 31 of the previous year (included). For example, if the current date is any day between 2021-01-01 and 2021-12-31, everything created up to and including 2020-12-31 will be downloaded. Because YouTube takes time to transcode videos (usually 1 week, maximum 1 month), you may want to avoid running the Archive Scripts too soon into the new year.

Active Scripts: Scripts that will download everything that was created after January 1 of the current year (included). For example, if the current date is 2021-02-02, everything created between and during the dates 2021-01-01 and 2021-02-02 will be downloaded.

### Watch on PC Scripts:

Watch Script: Script that will download individual videos made by a creator that are not meant to be archived but deleted after being watched, in modern video and audio format that are not always supported by mobile devices. (naming scheme: `Uploader - 20201231 - Title [VIDEOID].ext`).

Watch on Mobile Devices Script: Script that will download individual videos made by a creator that are not meant to be archived but deleted after being watched, in ancient video and audio format that are supported by every mobile devices. (naming scheme: `Uploader - 20201231 - Title [VIDEOID].ext`).

Consider the "Watch Scripts" and "Watch on Mobile Devices Script" useful for downloading "throwaway" videos. Data normally useful for archivers, such as the thumbnail, are omitted.
